# Rowing Classifier with Fast.ai

This is an Image Classifier that i created while doing the fast.ai course, it makes use of the fast.ai libraries to implement a RESNET 50 model which was trained on images downloaded using Bing Images. the classifier can differentiate between single sculling boats and quads (which have four scullers in each boat), as opposed to rowing which uses just one blade scullers have two blades each.
